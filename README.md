# Alto Recorder Christmas Music Book

This is a free, downloadable PDF of favourite holiday tunes and Christmas carols arranged for alto recorder.

All arrangements fit easily within the alto recorder range, and the difficulty ranges from easy to intermediate. I have left minimal articulations and tempo/dynamic suggestions so you can improvise.

The collection is continuously expanding and I am open for any suggestions of new pieces I can add. I hope that you enjoy them!


## LilyPond

Each piece is included as its own LilyPond file (*.ly* files in the *Individual-Scores* folder). To compile the full book, run the *Alto-Recorder-Christmas-Music-Book.ly* file (one way is to click on the lilypad icon in Frescobaldi).

P.S. If you are not already using it, I highly suggest using [Frescobaldi](https://www.frescobaldi.org), a free, interactive editor for LilyPond! It provides you with sheet music previews, a MIDI player so you can hear your score, and coding tools like error checking and a transposing tool.


### What is LilyPond?

LilyPond is a really cool code-based music engraving program that enables you to write music through a text editor. This is different than drag-and-drop based editors like MuseScore, but it is also much faster to work with.
